Caindid Images is a website where users can upload images (locally or with a url) and view at the images other people have uploaded. Did you spot something cool and happened to take an impromptu, candid shot of it? Upload it immeadiately and the incorporated Google Maps will display where you were when you uploaded so friends, family, pets, and strangers can also go to that location and spot something cool themselves.
