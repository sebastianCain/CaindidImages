Caindid Images is a website where users can upload images (locally or with a url) and view at the images other people have uploaded. Did you spot something cool and happened to take an impromptu, candid shot of it? Upload it immeadiately and the incorporated Google Maps will display where you were when you uploaded so friends, family, pets, and strangers can also go to that location and spot something cool themselves.

To use our website, activate your virtual environment. Then simply run "python app.py" and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser. Unregistered, you may only browse the gallery of uploaded images. However, once registered you may log in and upload your own images, whether from your machine or from a url. Only proper image files will be accepted. Once registered, you gain access to your profile, where you can see all your uploaded images.
